The Angular CLI downloads and install everything you need to test an Angular application with the Jasmine test framework.

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write test
Jasmine tests itself across many browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, PhantomJS, Microsoft Edge, and new Internet Explorer) as well as nodejs

The ng test command builds the app in watch mode, and launches the Karma test runner.

The last line of the log is the most important. It shows that Karma ran three tests that all passed.

A chrome browser also opens and displays the test output in the "Jasmine HTML Reporter" like this.

To see this in action, make a small change to app.component.ts and save. The tests run again, the browser refreshes, and the new test results appear.

Configuration
The CLI takes care of Jasmine and Karma configuration for you.

You can fine-tune many options by editing the karma.conf.js and the test.ts files in the src/ folder.

The karma.conf.js file is a partial Karma configuration file. The CLI constructs the full runtime configuration in memory, based on application structure specified in the angular.json file, supplemented by karma.conf.js.
